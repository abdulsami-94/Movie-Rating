Users can enter a movie name, provide a rating between **1–5**, and instantly see a descriptive result based on their rating.

This project is ideal for practising:

* Form handling
* Event listeners
* Switch-case logic
* DOM manipulation
* Basic UI layout

## 🧠 **How It Works**

1. User enters a **movie name**
2. User enters a **rating (1–5)**
3. When the form is submitted:

   * JavaScript prevents page reload

   * Uses a **switch-case** to convert rating into a message
   * Displays the final output inside the “answer” label
